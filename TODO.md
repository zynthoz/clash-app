# TODO List for UI Improvements

- [x] Update `pages/card-detail.html`: Replace nav structure to match `index.html` and `clan.html`, including adding `search-hide` class, media query in `<style>`, and mobile menu functionality.
- [x] Update `pages/clan.html`: Add CSS for text truncation on the "Name" column in the leaderboard table (e.g., `text-ellipsis` and `overflow-hidden`).
- [x] Update `pages/index.html`: Enhance mobile responsiveness by adjusting classes for better stacking on small screens (e.g., change grid to single column, adjust padding/margins, font sizes in hero and sections).
- [ ] Test the pages locally to ensure nav hides correctly at 1649px, text truncates in clan leaderboard, and homepage is more responsive on mobile.
